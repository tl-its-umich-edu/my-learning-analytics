## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of MyLA up and running on your local machine with anonymized/fake student data.

### Prerequisites

To follow the instructions below, you will at minimum need the following:
1. **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)**.
1. **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repo.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tl-its-umich-edu/my-learning-analytics.git
    ```

1. Then navigate into the repo.
    ```sh
    cd my-learning-analytics
    ```

1. Create a directory in your home directory called `mylasecrets`. This directory is mapped by `docker-compose.yml` into the container as `/secrets/`.
    ```sh
    mkdir ~/mylasecrets
    ```

1. Copy the `config/env_sample.hjson` file into `mylasecrets` as `env.hjson`.
    ```sh
    cp config/env_sample.hjson ~/mylasecrets/env.hjson
    ```

1. Copy the `config/cron.hjson` file into `mylasecrets`.
    ```sh
    cp config/cron.hjson ~/mylasecrets/cron.hjson
    ```

1. Examine the `env.hjson` file. You may need to change some of the configuration values for different environments,
e.g. localhost vs. a production deployment. There are comments to help determine the proper settings.
See [Configuration](configuration.md) for some additional info.

    > **Note:** You may also optionally place the JSON settings directly into the `ENV_JSON` environment variable
    > if your deployment environment doesn't easily support mounting the `env.hjson` file into container.
    > When using `ENV_JSON`, put the entire contents of `env.hjson` into it as a single-line string.

1. Copy the `.env.sample` file as `.env`. 
    ```sh
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```

1. Examine the `.env` file. It will have the suggested default environment variable settings,
mostly just MySQL information as well as locations of other configuration files.

1. Start the Docker build process (this will take some time).
    ```sh
    docker compose build
    ```

1. Start up the web server and database containers.
    ```sh
    docker compose up
    ```

    > **Note:** Use `docker compose down` and `^C` at any time to stop the running containers.

1. Download the latest SQL file from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Pj7roNjRPGyumKKal8-h5E6ukUiXTDI9), and move it into the repository.

1. Load the database with data.
    ```sh
    docker exec -i student_dashboard_mysql mysql \
        -u student_dashboard_user \
        --password=student_dashboard_pw student_dashboard \
        < {name of sql file}
    ```

#### Logging in as admininstrator

1. Navigate to http://localhost:5001/ and log in as `root` with password `root`.

As you are now logged in as `root`, there are no courses listed.
To view a course and the visualizations as an admin, do the following:

1. Go to the Django admin panel by clicking the avatar in the top right, then clicking "Admin",
or navigate to http://localhost:5001/admin.

2. Click on "Courses" under "Dashboard" in the right-hand panel.

3. Click on one of the "Link" links in the "Course Link" column for one of the three courses.

#### Logging in as a student

1. If you are logged in as `root`, click on the top-right circle, then click "Logout".

1. Connect to the MySQL database.
    ```txt
    Host: 127.0.0.1
    Username: student_dashboard_user
    Password: student_dashboard_pw
    Database: student_dashboard
    Port: 5306
    ```
    
1. Pick a student `sis_name` from the `user` table to be used in the next step.
    ```sql
    SELECT sis_name FROM `user` WHERE enrollment_type = 'StudentEnrollment';
    ```

1. Create an authorized user.
    ```sh
    docker exec -it student_dashboard python manage.py createuser \
        --username={insert sis_name} \
        --password={create password} \
        --email=test@test.com
    ```
    
    > **Note:** To make a user a superuser, edit the record in `auth_user` to set `is_staff=1` and `is_superuser=1`.
    
1. Login using the username and password created.

1. The course(s) the student with the selected `sis_name` are enrolled in will be displayed.
Click on a course to view as the student selected in step 3.
